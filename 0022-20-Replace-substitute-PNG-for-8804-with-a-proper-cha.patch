 <p>The <a name="marker-895486"></a>mitre limit is a little more complex than the others, so it is explained here rather than above. At any given corner, the mitre length is the distance from the point at which the inner edges of the stroke meet, to the point where the outer edges of the stroke meet. This distance increases as the angle between the lines decreases. If the ratio of the mitre length to the line width exceeds the mitre limit, stroke treats the corner with a bevel join instead of a mitre join. Also see the notes on scaling, later in this section.</p>

 <p>This call loads a template. You must have previously called Wimp_OpenTemplate to open the template.</p>
 <p>The space required by the buffer passed in R1 is 88 bytes for the window, 32 bytes for each icon and room for the initial values of all indirected data fields, since all of these things are initially copied into the buffer. The indirected data is then copied by the Wimp into the workspace area pointed to by R2. The font reference array is also updated if fonts are used.</p>
-<p>The required sizes of the buffer and workspace area are hard to work out, and so in RISC OS 3 the option was added whereby you can find these values by setting R1 <img src="../SYMBOLS/ENTITIES/8804.PNG" alt="&LT;="> 0. You should use this option where possible.</p>
+<p>The required sizes of the buffer and workspace area are hard to work out, and so in RISC OS 3 the option was added whereby you can find these values by setting R1 ≤ 0. You should use this option where possible.</p>
 <p>Window templates are created by the <a name="marker-155111"></a>template creation utility (FormEd). They are stored in a file, and each template has a name associated with it. Because the search name may be wildcarded, it is possible to search for all templates of a given form (e.g. dialog*) by calling Wimp_LoadTemplate with R6=0 the first time, then using the value passed back for subsequent calls. R6 will be returned as 0 on the call after the last template is found. As the wildcarded name is overwritten by the actual one found, it must be re-initialised before every call and must be big enough to have the template name written into it.</p>
 <p>The indirected icon workspace pointer is provided so that when the window definition is read into the buffer addressed by R1, its icon fields can be set correctly. An indirected icon's data is read from the file into the workspace addressed by R2, and the icon data pointer fields in the window definition are set appropriately. R2 is updated, and if it becomes greater than R3, a <tt>Window definition won't fit</tt> error is given.</p>
 <p>The <a name="marker-155467"></a>font reference count array is used to overcome the problem caused with dynamically allocated <a name="marker-155468"></a>font handles. When a template file is created, font information such as size, font name etc is stored along with the font handle that was returned for the font in FormEd. When a template is subsequently loaded, the Wimp calls Font_FindFont and replaces references to the original font number with the new handle. It then increments the entry for that handle in the reference array. This array should be initialised to zero before the first call to Wimp_LoadTemplate.</p>
