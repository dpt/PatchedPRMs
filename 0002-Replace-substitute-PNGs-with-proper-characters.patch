 <p>Procedure and function calls have been enhanced in the following ways: value and result parameters (RETURN parameters), array parameters and local arrays, procedure libraries (LIBRARY, INSTALL and OVERLAY), LOCAL DATA and LOCAL ERROR handlers, a relative RESTORE statement which does not require the use of line numbers.</p>
 <p>Many array operations have been introduced. These include: local arrays and array reference parameters, whole arrays operations such as assignment, four-function arithmetic, matrix and vector multiplication, SUM of array elements, the DIM function to find information on array parameters, array element initialisation, MOD (square root of the sum of the squares of a numeric array).</p>
 <p>Several new operators have been introduced: &lt;&lt; (left shift), &gt;&gt; (arithmetic right shift), &gt;&gt;&gt; (logical right shift), | (floating point indirection), += (increment assignment, including all the elements of an array), -= (decrement assignment). The character % introduces binary constants as &amp; introduces hexadecimal ones.</p>

Each of these has two tokens, one for when it is used as a statement (e.g. TIME=<img src="../../SYMBOLS/ENTITIES/8230.PNG" alt="...">) and one when it is used as a function (PRINT TIME).

The difference is in the way that BASIC tokenises the pseudo-variables.

As you will generally use MATCH to tokenise an expression string, you will use MODE = 1.</p>
 <p>The CONSTA value is 0 if you do not want BASIC to convert integers which could be line numbers (in the range 0 to 65279) into internal format, and 1 if you do. Internal format consists of the token &amp;8D followed by three bytes which contain the encoded line number. A property of these bytes is that they lie in the range 64 to 127, and therefore do not contain control codes or tokens.</p>
 <p>Encoded constants are used for line numbers after GOTO, GOSUB, RESTORE, THEN and ELSE keywords. Because they are of fixed length, the program can be renumbered without having to move program lines about. Because they don't contain special characters, certain BASIC search operations (e.g. for the ELSE in a single-line IF) are speeded up.</p>
 <p>Both MODE and CONSTA will be updated during the use of the routine. For example, GOTO will set CONSTA to &amp;8D to read the line number, PRINT will change MODE to 1 to read an expression. The table below summarises the setting of MODE and CONSTA:</p>

 <p>The <a name="marker-895486"></a>mitre limit is a little more complex than the others, so it is explained here rather than above. At any given corner, the mitre length is the distance from the point at which the inner edges of the stroke meet, to the point where the outer edges of the stroke meet. This distance increases as the angle between the lines decreases. If the ratio of the mitre length to the line width exceeds the mitre limit, stroke treats the corner with a bevel join instead of a mitre join. Also see the notes on scaling, later in this section.</p>

 <p>All block sizes allocated are in bytes and are rounded up to a multiple of four bytes. All blocks returned to the user are word-aligned<a name="marker-828854"></a>. All blocks have an overhead of eight bytes (two words). One word is used to hold the block's length and status, the other contains a <a name="marker-828855"></a>guard constant which is used to detect heap corruptions. The guard word may not be present in future releases of the ANSI C library. When the stack needs to be extended, blocks are <a name="marker-828856"></a>allocated from the <tt>malloc</tt> heap.</p>
 <p>When an allocation request is received<a name="marker-828857"></a> by the storage manager, it is categorised into one of three sizes of blocks</p>
 <ul>
-<li>small - 0 <img src="../SYMBOLS/ENTITIES/8594.PNG" alt="-&GT;"> 64 bytes
-<li>medium - 65 <img src="../SYMBOLS/ENTITIES/8594.PNG" alt="-&GT;"> 512 bytes

 </ul>
 <p>The <a name="marker-828858"></a>storage manager keeps track of the free sections of the heap in two ways. The medium and large sized blocks are chained together into a linked list (<a name="marker-828947"></a>overflow list) and small blocks of the same size are chained together into linked lists (<a name="marker-828860"></a>bins). The overflow list is ordered by ascending block address, while the bins have the most recently freed block at the start of the list.</p>
 <p>When a small block is requested, the bin which contains the blocks of the required size is checked, and, if the bin is not empty, the first block in the list is returned to the user. If there was not a block of the exact size available, the bin containing blocks of the next size up is checked, and so on until a block is found. If a block is not found in the bins, the last block (highest address) on the overflow list is taken. If <a name="marker-828861"></a>the block is large enough to be split into two blocks, and the remainder is a usable size (&gt; 12 including the overhead) then the block is split, the top section returned to the user and the remainder, depending on its size, is either put in the relevant bin at the front of the list or left in the overflow list.</p>

The call returns a pointer to the next byte to be removed from the buffer, and the number of bytes which can be removed from that address onwards. In the next call R3 should equal the number of bytes read since the last call, at which point the buffer indices will be updated to purge the data, and the next filled block will be returned. </p>

 <p>Window templates are created by the <a name="marker-155111"></a>template creation utility (FormEd). They are stored in a file, and each template has a name associated with it. Because the search name may be wildcarded, it is possible to search for all templates of a given form (e.g. dialog*) by calling Wimp_LoadTemplate with R6=0 the first time, then using the value passed back for subsequent calls. R6 will be returned as 0 on the call after the last template is found. As the wildcarded name is overwritten by the actual one found, it must be re-initialised before every call and must be big enough to have the template name written into it.</p>
 <p>The indirected icon workspace pointer is provided so that when the window definition is read into the buffer addressed by R1, its icon fields can be set correctly. An indirected icon's data is read from the file into the workspace addressed by R2, and the icon data pointer fields in the window definition are set appropriately. R2 is updated, and if it becomes greater than R3, a <tt>Window definition won't fit</tt> error is given.</p>
 <p>The <a name="marker-155467"></a>font reference count array is used to overcome the problem caused with dynamically allocated <a name="marker-155468"></a>font handles. When a template file is created, font information such as size, font name etc is stored along with the font handle that was returned for the font in FormEd. When a template is subsequently loaded, the Wimp calls Font_FindFont and replaces references to the original font number with the new handle. It then increments the entry for that handle in the reference array. This array should be initialised to zero before the first call to Wimp_LoadTemplate.</p>
