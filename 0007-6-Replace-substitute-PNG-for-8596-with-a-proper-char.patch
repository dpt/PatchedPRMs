 <p>Type in the line number you want to move to, then click on <b>OK</b>. The dialogue box disappears, and the screen displays the caret, positioned at the beginning of the line you have just specified. Note that this option understands 'line' to mean the string of characters between two presses of Return. If you have not formatted your text, a line in this sense may run over more than one display line.</p>
 <p><a name="marker-306539"></a><b>Undo</b> allows you to step backwards through the most recent changes you have made to the text. The number of changes you can reverse in this way varies according to the operations involved.</p>

+<p><a name="marker-306543"></a><b>CR↔︎LF</b> allows you to convert the linefeeds in your text to carriage returns (and carriage returns to linefeeds). Carriage returns appear as the characters [0d] in your text.</p>
 <p>If you convert from linefeeds to carriage returns, the file will be converted to one continuous line, with carriage return characters inserted where linefeeds have been removed. Though it is possible to edit a file in this state, you may find that updating the screen takes a long time. This facility is useful when importing text from other text editors, which may use carriage r<a name="marker-306547"></a>eturns where SrcEdit uses line feeds.</p>
 <p><b>Expand <a name="marker-306549"></a>Tabs</b> converts each tab character into eight spaces, since some printers can interpret spaces more easily than the tab character. If you have imported a file that was produced on a word processor, you may find it uses tab characters. These appear in the SrcEdit file as the characters [09] in your text.</p>
 <p><b>For<a name="marker-306551"></a>mat text</b> allows you to reformat a paragraph of text - from the caret to the next blank line or line starting with a space - so that the lines fill the screen and break correctly at the ends of words. It is useful for tidying up text after editing. Position the caret at the beginning of the paragraph, choose <b>Format text</b> in the Edit menu and enter the number of characters per line you want your text to have in the <b><a name="marker-306553"></a>Format width</b> dialogue box. Then move the pointer back over the Edit menu and click on <b>Format text</b> to format the paragraph.</p>
